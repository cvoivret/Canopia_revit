# CANOPIA REVIT project

## About
This repos contains multiples projects to add functionnalities to Autodesk Revit.
They have been developped during the CANOPIA Project in order to help architect and engineer to build better in tropical climate.
Each functionnality is composed of three bricks : the core library, a revit command (without GUI), a revit extrenal app (with GUI).
